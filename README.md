### Second Part

In the second part, one  additional feature is added:

- **Synchronize List**
  - Description: A button "Sync" is added on the customer list page. By hitting this button it will triggers a call to a remote API to get the customer list. The retrieved customers are then saved in the database. If a customer already exists in the database, their information is updated instead of inserting a new record. for this you need to download frontend repositor or use postman (**for postman**:http://localhost:8080/home/api/customers/search/sunbase)
